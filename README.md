## 🎯 Purpose

Caelus is an intelligent AI-powered web app that helps **high schoolers, students, and anyone seeking direction** make better life and career decisions — responsibly and ethically.

This is more than just an app — it's a **framework** for running high-performance small language models on older hardware, giving near large-model capabilities without the computational cost.

> 🚀 Built to run on a GTX 1650 Mobile with 4GB VRAM — a GPU that predates the AI boom.

## 🔬 Core Projects Inside

1. **🧠 A Scalable Small LLM Framework**
   - Implements a **novel technique** to enhance small models like **Qwen1.5 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B**
   - **Bypasses token limitations**, drastically improving reasoning and usability
   - Extremely **lightweight**, with performance scaling based on device capacity

2. **📚 Caelus: The App**
   - Built on this framework
   - Helps users explore potential careers, reflect on decisions, and gain insight using conversational AI
   - Modular and easy to integrate into any pipeline or product
